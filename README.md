This repository contains helper scripts and template files for demo of RedHat Developer Hub integrating with OpenShift Virtualization. 
The demo is based on demo.redhat.com infrastructure provisioned. If you are running in your own environment, please be noted that you have to provision RHDH with Gitlab and ArgoCD before hand.
